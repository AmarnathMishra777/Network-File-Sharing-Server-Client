# Network-File-Sharing-Server-Client
Project Title:

Network File Sharing Server & Client

Project Description:

The Network File Sharing Server & Client project is a socket-based application designed to enable secure and efficient file transfer between multiple systems connected over a network. The system follows a client-server architecture, where the server hosts and shares files, and the client can connect to the server to browse, request, and download files.

The project demonstrates the fundamentals of network programming using Python sockets, providing a hands-on understanding of how data is transmitted between machines over TCP/IP connections.

Objectives:

To establish reliable communication between a server and multiple clients using socket programming.

To implement a system that allows clients to view available files on the server.

To enable secure file transfer from the server to the client.

To gain practical experience in building and managing network-based applications.

Key Features:

Server-Client Communication: The server listens for incoming client connections and handles multiple requests.

File Listing: The client can request and view the list of files stored on the server.

File Downloading: Clients can select and download any file from the server.

Error Handling: Handles connection failures and missing files gracefully.

Scalable Design: Can be extended to include upload functionality, authentication, or encryption.

Technology Stack:

Programming Language: Python

Libraries Used: socket, os

Platform: Cross-platform (Windows/Linux/Mac)

Environment: Google Colab / Local Python Environment

Learning Outcomes:

Understanding the fundamentals of socket programming and network communication.

Gaining practical experience in client-server architecture and file handling.

Developing skills in designing robust and scalable network applications.
